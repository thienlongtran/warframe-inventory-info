# Warframe Inventory Info

This is a program created with Python for the primary purpose of keeping track of a Warframe player's prime parts in a time efficient manner. The program will prevent users from manually needing to maintain a list of their items as well as the corresponding quantities, ducat values, and warframe.market prices.

Currently, this program is operational with very specific conditions including playing Warframe on a 1920x1080 monitor with fullscreen mode. This program is also lacking some important features and has a few bugs. However, I plan on adding these features, fixing the bugs, and allowing the program to work with looser conditions in the future.
